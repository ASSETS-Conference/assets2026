                    <p>Mentoring is an important process that helps bring new researchers into the ASSETS community and to ensure that papers are accessible to everyone. Mentors can assist in paper writing and accessible submission information. This page provides information for Mentors and Mentees for ASSETS 2023 including expectations and applications.</p>

                    <p><b>Mentorship</b>: Help from seasoned researchers is available through the ASSETS Mentoring Program. You may receive advice on a submission in any of the submission categories provided by ASSETS. If you think you would benefit from mentoring because you are new to presenting your research, new to the type of category you would like to submit to, or seek assistance in preparing an accessible paper, please consider applying for mentoring help. The deadline to request a mentor is <b>Friday, March 31, 2023</b>.
                    </p>

                    <p>Mentors provide feedback to authors on a draft of their paper and particularly highlight how an ASSETS paper could differ from other conferences in expectations. Mentors are not co-authors on the paper, their role is to provide advice during the writing process. Mentoring is not a pre-requisite for submitting a paper to ASSETS. It is meant to help bring in researchers to our community.</p>

                    <p>Help from seasoned researchers is available through the ASSETS Mentoring Program. You may receive advice on a submission in any of the submission categories provided by ASSETS. If you think you would benefit from mentoring because you are new to presenting your research, new to the type of category you would like to submit to, or simply find preparing an English-language or accessible paper to be difficult, please consider applying for mentoring help.</p>

                    <p>
                        Mentoring typically pertains to the process of composing the submission, with one to two communication sessions. After reviews are received, mentees are encouraged to contact their mentor again and seek advice on interpreting the reviewers' comments. Even if the submission is accepted, this final session may help the mentee produce an even better camera-ready version.

                        Mentors can also provide advice on creating more accessible papers for submission. It is important to the ASSETS community that the research we produce is accessible to everyone and at every stage of the publication process. However, producing accessible research articles, especially in PDF format, can be challenging. If you are new to this process, refer to the <a href="https://assets23.sigaccess.org/guidelines-policies.html#a11y-pdfs" target="_blank">instructions on Creating Accessible PDFs</a>. If you are new to producing accessible documents or are looking for advice on how to make your research more accessible, please join our mentoring program. This is not a service to make your paper accessible for you, but accessibility mentors will help all authors get the advice and resources they need for the process.

                        Participating in the ASSETS Mentoring Program does not guarantee that ASSETS will accept your submission. However, most individuals who have used the mentoring service at ASSETS or at the CHI conference where it began have reported positive experiences and an improved understanding of what reviewers require in general.

                    <p>Mentoring is an important process that helps bring new researchers into the ASSETS community. Potential mentors should have had at least one accepted paper at past ASSETS and be willing to spend the time as indicated above. If you are interested in being a mentor, please email the mentoring chairs (<a href="mailto:mentoring-assets23@acm.org">mentoring-assets23@acm.org</a>) by Friday, March 31, 2023, to indicate your area of expertise.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="text-left">Suggested Communication Process</h4>
                    <p>
                        Once we have put the mentor and mentee in touch, they are of course free to choose whatever communication method they prefer. One possibility (that really works, at no cost!) is the following:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The mentee sends the submission by email to the mentor to give her/him/them a chance to read it in advance,
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The mentor and mentee set up an appointment for a video call by email,
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The mentee uploads the text to a <a href="https://docs.google.com" target="_blank">Google Doc</a> and shares a link to it with the mentor,
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            At the scheduled time, the mentor and mentee establish the video call and both open the shared file in a web browser.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        That way they can talk about the submission and simultaneously edit it, instantly seeing what the counterpart does – almost as good as meeting face-to-face!
